      Many tools exist to help you build web apps, but very few deal with the fundamental problem:

      Ractive changes that.


      RactiveJs is very simple to get started and it's powerful enough to help you get things done
      perfectly without the hassle and learning curve.


      It also has great performance.

    title: What You Should Know About Streams
    description: >
      The way we consume services from the Internet today includes many instances of streaming
      data, both downloading from a service as well as uploading to it or peer-to-peer data
      transfers. Regarding data as a stream of elements instead of in its entirety is very useful
      because it matches the way computers send and receive them (for example via TCP), but it is
      often also a necessity because data sets frequently become too large to be handled as a whole.
      We spread computations or analyses over large clusters and call it “big data”, where the whole
      principle of processing them is by feeding those data sequentially—as a stream—through some
      CPUs.


      This talk is a primer to understanding how the Akka Streams API work, its motivation and
      design.

      to view the sensor data. What are some key things to look out for in the BLE protocol? What
      are some of the common hardware chips, dev kits and firmware API? What are some hardware tools

      Rust is a systems programming language designed for speed, safety, concurrency and hype. It

      collectors, while still maintaining compile time safety gurantees.

      Analysts have always been creating reports which they can then use for analysing the
      performance of their business. Common tools they would use to do so are Spreadsheets but doing
      so would mean that they would have to recreate the report each time it is requested. In order
      to combat this, some would use R or VBA to automate some of the dataflows to make it easier to
      recreate those said reports.

      Google BigQuery, Google Spreadsheets, Google Analytics and Slack in order to create automated

    description: >
      In this talk we will compare different concurrency models of languages such as Ruby, Node.js,
      JVM (Java/Clojure STM/Scala Actor) and Erlang.


      Ruby supports concurrency but wit GIL, it cant run threads parallely. We will explore options
      available that makes this problem irrelevant. Node.js doesn’t support concurrency or
      parallelism.


      Node.js is single threaded. It runs an event loop which makes non blocking IO possible. We
      will explore why Node.js fits well to only certain types of problems only.


      JVM supports native threads and thus achieves true parallelism. But in JVM memory is still
      shared among different objects. We will explore JVM architecture in regards with memory. Where
      JVM gets it wrong.


      Erlang/Elixir achieves concurrency and parallelism with shared nothing, immutable data, first
      class processes, actor model. We will explore whether this approach is better for solving
      every kind of problem. Talk will have deep comparison with all of these platforms in regards
      with what most real world project need.

      The Espressif System's ESP32 is a dual Wi-Fi/BT 'wonder' chip that is poised to be the
      game-changer in the IoT space. Within days of announcing its availability to the market,
      thousands of chips & modules were snapped up worldwide. As beta testers & evaluators of the
      ESP32 prototype, we felt that while the hardware holds much promise, programming it will be
      the biggest headache for those eager buyers. This is because unlike the ESP8266 which can be
      program with non-OS and FreeRTOS, the ESP32 requires a new FreeRTOS-based architecture dev
      framework known as the ESP-IDF.


      At the point of writing/submission, the development for the
      ESP-IDF is still ongoing. Working in collaboration with a few eminent hackers & engineers from
      the region, I had the good fortune to code test some early versions of the upcoming ESP-32
      development board from the designers of the Arduino Nano and Espresso Lite (codenamed the
      Nano32). In this presentation I hope to do a basic programming demo e.g. controlling sensors
      and actuators, connecting it to the web, making API calls, communicating with other
      webservices, etc.
